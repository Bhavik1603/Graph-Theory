<b>These programs demonstrate three different representations of a graph: adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list.</b> <br>
## Graph
![Graph.png](https://github.com/Bhavik1603/Graph-Theory/blob/main/1.%20Graph%20Representation/Graph.png)
## Outputs
<b>Adjacency Matrix</b>
```bash
Adjacency Matrix representation of the graph:
0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0
```

<b>Adjacency List</b>
```bash
Adjacency List representation of the graph:
0 -> 1 4
1 -> 0 2 3 4
2 -> 1 3
3 -> 1 2 4
4 -> 0 1 3
```
<b>Edge List</b>
```bash
Edge List representation of the graph:
0 -> 1
1 -> 0
0 -> 4
4 -> 0
1 -> 2
2 -> 1
1 -> 3
3 -> 1
1 -> 4
4 -> 1
2 -> 3
3 -> 2
3 -> 4
4 -> 3
```
