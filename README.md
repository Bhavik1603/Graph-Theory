# Graph-Theory
Graph Theory Programs which I learned during my academics.
Here are some graph theory programs you can explore and implement:
<ol>
  <li><b>Graph Representation:</b> Write programs to represent graphs using various data structures like adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list.</li>
  <li><b>Graph Traversals:</b> Implement depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to traverse a graph and explore its nodes.</li>
  <li><b>Shortest Path Algorithms:</b> Develop programs to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>Minimum Spanning Tree:</b> Write a program to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using algorithms like Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>Topological Sorting:</b> Implement algorithms to perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</li>
  <li><b>Cycle Detection:</b> Create a program to detect cycles in a graph, especially for directed graphs.</li>
  <li><b>Connectivity:</b> Develop programs to check if a graph is connected and find connected components in an undirected graph.</li>
  <li><b>Graph Coloring:</b> Implement graph coloring algorithms to assign colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.</li>
  <li><b>Eulerian Path and Circuit:</b> Write programs to find Eulerian paths and circuits in a graph.</li>
  <li><b>Hamiltonian Path and Circuit:</b> Develop programs to find Hamiltonian paths and circuits in a graph.</li>
  <li><b>Maximum Flow:</b> Implement algorithms to find the maximum flow in a flow network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or Edmonds-Karp algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>Matching Algorithms:</b> Write programs to find maximum cardinality matching or maximum weight matching in bipartite graphs.</li>
