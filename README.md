# Graph-Theory
Graph Theory Programs which I learned during my academics.
Here are some graph theory programs you can explore and implement:

Graph Representation: Write programs to represent graphs using various data structures like adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list.

Graph Traversals: Implement depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to traverse a graph and explore its nodes.

Shortest Path Algorithms: Develop programs to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Minimum Spanning Tree: Write a program to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using algorithms like Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.

Topological Sorting: Implement algorithms to perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Cycle Detection: Create a program to detect cycles in a graph, especially for directed graphs.

Connectivity: Develop programs to check if a graph is connected and find connected components in an undirected graph.

Graph Coloring: Implement graph coloring algorithms to assign colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Eulerian Path and Circuit: Write programs to find Eulerian paths and circuits in a graph.

Hamiltonian Path and Circuit: Develop programs to find Hamiltonian paths and circuits in a graph.

Maximum Flow: Implement algorithms to find the maximum flow in a flow network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

Matching Algorithms: Write programs to find maximum cardinality matching or maximum weight matching in bipartite graphs.
