The DFS method uses recursion to traverse the graph depth-first, while the BFS method uses a queue for breadth-first traversal. <br>
We create a sample graph with 6 vertices and perform both DFS and BFS traversals. The output of the traversals will depend on the order in which edges are added.

## Output
```bash
Breadth-First Traversal (BFS): 0 1 2 3 4 5 
```
```bash
Depth-First Traversal (DFS): 0 1 3 4 2 5 
```
